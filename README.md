# Next.js 15 RSC Data Fetching Error

This repository demonstrates a runtime error encountered in a Next.js 15 application when using React Server Components (RSC) and attempting to fetch data. The error is unusual because the setup appears correct at first glance, but the application fails to render properly.

## Problem Description

The issue involves a seemingly simple Next.js 15 application.  Despite using standard approaches for data fetching, the application throws an error during runtime. The error message may vary, but usually relates to data fetching or RSC. The exact cause may be subtle, such as unexpected data mutations, conflicting data loading mechanisms, or hidden dependencies. 

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing all data fetching and manipulation steps within the server and client components. Correcting the error depends on the specific circumstances, it could involve:

* **Properly handling asynchronous operations:** Ensuring data is fetched successfully and error handling is in place.
* **Data consistency:** Preventing race conditions or unexpected data transformations.
* **Component lifecycle management:** Understanding and handling component re-renders.
* **Dependency management:** Ensuring all packages are compatible.

This repository provides code examples to illustrate the problem and its solution.  Feel free to adapt and expand upon it to address similar issues in your projects.  The solution implementation focuses on meticulous review and careful data handling techniques for RSC in Next.js 15.
